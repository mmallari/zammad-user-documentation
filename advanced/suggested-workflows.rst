Sharing Work on a Ticket
------------------------

When a ticket is complex enough,
it may require attention from more than one agent
(or even more than one department!).

In these cases, the simplest thing to do
is usually just to **take turns working on the ticket**.
(:doc:`Splitting tickets </advanced/ticket-actions/split>` is another option,
best reserved for when a ticket really encompasses multiple problems,
or when taking turns would needlessly block one agent’s progress.)

   Reassign a ticket (via the *Group* and *Owner* settings)
   to let colleagues know you’re done with your part.

How it works
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Suppose a call comes into the sales department.
A sales rep takes the call, creates a ticket,
and looks up some prices for the customer.
After recording his notes,
the rep then decides that this ticket needs to be passed onto customer service.

Our sales rep can simply un-assign himself as the **owner** of the ticket
and re-assign the ticket to the Customer Service **group**.
*All customer service agents will be notified of the incoming ticket*,
and the first available agent can assign herself
to pick up where the sales rep left off.

.. tip:: Be sure to leave notes with as much information as possible for the next agent!
